Post logout Route Design Recipe

_Copy this design recipe template to test-drive a Sinatra route._

## 1. Design the Route Signature

You'll need to include:
  * the HTTP method
  * the path
  * any query parameters (passed in the URL)
  * or body parameters (passed in the request body)


POST /logout
no parameters


## 2. Design the Response

The route might return different responses, depending on the result.

For example, a route for a specific blog post (by its ID) might return `200 OK` if the post exists, but `404 Not Found` if the post is not found in the database.

Your response might return plain text, JSON, or HTML code. 

_Replace the below with your own design. Think of all the different possible responses your route will return._

```html
<!-- EXAMPLE -->
<!-- Response 302 OK and returns the user to the page listing all spaces -->

All spaces

<div>
  Name:
  Short description:
  Price:
</div>


```

## 3. Write Examples

_Replace these with your own design._

```
# Request:
GET /spaces
# Expected response:
Response for 200 OK
```


## 4. Encode as Tests Examples

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# file: spec/integration/app_spec.rb
require "spec_helper"
describe Application do
  include Rack::Test::Methods
  let(:app) { Application.new }
  context "GET /spaces" do
    it 'returns 200 OK and returns list of spaces' do
      response = get('/spaces')

      expect(response.status).to eq(200)
      expect(response.body).to include("<h2>Space1</h2>")
    end
  end
end
```

## 5. Implement the Route

Write the route and web server code to implement the route behaviour.
